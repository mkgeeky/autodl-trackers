## Update

I have forked and edited [autodl-irssi](https://github.com/mkgeeky/autodl-irssi), so the Update button now will work from ruTorrent.

You can still use [autodl-tracker-updater](https://github.com/mkgeeky/autodl-trackers-updater) if you don't want to change (to update) in the original autodl-irssi code.
